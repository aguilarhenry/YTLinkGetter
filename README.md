# Youtube Playlist Link Getter

Yes! I know the name is a little unwieldy, but this is what it does. It gets links from youtube playlists.

The app takes playlist source code as input, and yields a list of youtube video/music links as output. 
Maybe someday I'll get around to actually automating the whole process, but for now, you gotta get the playlist source first.
It was the fastest way to solve my particular problem =)

The application uses very simple logic, and I'm only sharing it because it was a time saver in that one use case. 
Maybe it can help someone else as well.

Take it and use it in good health. The software is provided as-is and you can do whatever you like with it. 
I don't provide any warranty for its functionality and I might update it for giggles (or if I need it again) at some point in the future.

This thing is barebones functionality so don't expect anything fancy from it!

Have fun!
